//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let movies = ["last Of Us", "Hell Yeah", "Independence day"];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let mov1 = movies[0];
console.log(mov1);

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let len = movies.length;
console.log(len);

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastElement = movies[movies.length - 1]
console.log(lastElement);
